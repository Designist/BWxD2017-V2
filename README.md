# BWxD2017

## What is BWxD?
Better World by Design is a student-led initiative at Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design that celebrates interdisciplinary collaboration between designers, educators, innovators, and learners. We envision a world where design-thinking is accessible to everyone in order to catalyze positive change on a local and global scale.
