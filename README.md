# BWxD2017

## What is BWxD?
Better World by Design is a student-led initiative at Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design that celebrates interdisciplinary collaboration between designers, educators, innovators, and learners. We envision a world where design-thinking is accessible to everyone in order to catalyze positive change on a local and global scale.

## How does this repository work?
The most up-to-date, cutting-edge version of the website is stored in the [testing/public_html](https://github.com/Designist/BWxD2017/tree/master/testing/public_html) folder. This is scheduled to release on 19 March 2017. Some code is taken from [Matt Cooper's 2016 conference site](https://github.com/dyelax/bwxd-2016).
